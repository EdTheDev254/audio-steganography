# Audio Steganography

The purpose of this project is to use LSB (Least Significant Bit) encoding to hide a significant amount of text data within a standard .wav audio file without creating any perceptible audio artifacts. The objective was to develop a program capable of embedding a text file containing several thousand characters into a carrier audio file in a way that is truly covert. The project is defined not by whether the data can be hidden and recovered, but by whether the resulting audio file is indistinguishable from the original to a human listener.
